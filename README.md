In this project I've tried to make a Quizhubb website in which an authentication system is provided for the users to signup and login.
after logging in,the users are allowed to create quiz on their own.
they are also allowed to search for other users by email,which facilitates their profile page.
the profile page allows other users to challenge quiz which is created by that particular user.
each quiz consists 3 questions and 3 options for each question.please try filling all the three questions and options to experience it completely.

setup:

I've made backend with node.js and mongodb.please start the server and connect with the mongodb database using the mongoURL by running npm start in the command prompt.
I've used React.js for frontend,in that folder open new terminal and run the following commands:
cd second-app
npm start
now,the site will be already for use.
